🌐 **Website**: [pasabayan.com](http://pasabayan.com)

Pasabayan is a peer-to-peer delivery platform that connects travelers (carriers) with people who need items delivered (shippers). The name "Pasabayan" comes from the Filipino word "pasabay" meaning "to hitch a ride" or "to send along with someone."

### Our Mission
To make deliveries more affordable, sustainable, and community-driven by utilizing existing travel routes.

### How It Works
1. **Carriers** post their upcoming trips with available space
2. **Shippers** post package requests with pickup/delivery locations
3. The platform matches compatible trips and packages
4. Secure payments are held in escrow until delivery is confirmed

### Match & Package Lifecycle (Shipper Perspective)

#### Matches Tab = The Conversation + Delivery Journey
Think of the **Matches** tab as the place where a request becomes a real delivery.

**Typical journey**
1. **A carrier makes an offer** → You can Accept, Counter‑Offer, or Decline.
2. **You request a carrier trip** → You're waiting for the carrier to respond.
3. **Both sides agree** → The request is accepted and moves forward.
4. **Booking confirmed** → Delivery can begin.
5. **Picked up → In transit → Delivered** → The delivery progresses until completion.
6. **Cancelled / Declined** → The delivery ends without completion.

#### Packages Tab = Your Requests List
Think of **Packages** as the list of everything you created.

**Typical journey**
1. **Created** → You made a package request.
2. **Waiting for offers** → Carriers can browse and offer to carry it.
3. **Matched** → A carrier offer is active (appears in Matches tab).
4. **Confirmed** → The package is locked to a carrier.
5. **Completed / Delivered** → The delivery is finished.
6. **Cancelled / Expired** → The request ends without delivery.

#### How They Connect
- **Packages tab** = what you created.
- **Matches tab** = what is actively being negotiated or delivered.
- When someone offers (or you request), it appears in **Matches**.
- Once delivery is done, both tabs reflect completion.

### Shipper Matches Tab Structure

**Tab Index:** 1 | **Title:** Matches | **Root View:** \`ShipperMatchesView\`

The Matches tab is the shipper's main hub for ongoing negotiations and active deliveries. It includes status filters, a counter-offer filter when available, and card-level actions via a 3‑dot menu.

      ↓
(decline) → counterOffer (new match) ──→ carrierRequested

## How Matching Works

### What is a Match?
A "match" connects a **carrier's trip** with a **shipper's package request**. It represents an agreement for the carrier to deliver the shipper's package along their travel route.

### Compatibility Criteria
Trips and packages are matched based on:
1. **Route overlap** - Package pickup/delivery cities align with trip origin/destination
2. **Timing** - Trip departure date allows enough time for pickup
3. **Capacity** - Trip has enough available weight (kg) for the package
4. **Price fit** - Carrier's price_per_kg fits within shipper's max_price_budget

### Discovery Options
- **Carrier finds package**: Browse "Find Packages" → filter by route → see compatible requests → send delivery offer
- **Shipper finds carrier**: Browse "Find Trips" → filter by route/date → see compatible trips → request delivery

### Match Status Flow
\`\`\`
[carrier_requested/shipper_requested] → [accepted] → [confirmed] → [picked_up] → [in_transit] → [delivered]
\`\`\`

| Status | What It Means | Who Acts Next |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| carrier_requested | Carrier offered to deliver | Shipper decides |
| shipper_requested | Shipper requested carrier | Carrier decides |
| accepted | Other party agreed | Both confirm details |
| confirmed | Both committed, payment held | Carrier picks up |
| picked_up | Carrier has the package | Carrier travels |
| in_transit | En route to destination | Carrier delivers |
| delivered | Handoff complete with code | Done! |

## Payment Flow

### How Payments Work (Step-by-Step)

1. **Match Confirmed** → Shipper's payment is charged and held in escrow
2. **Carrier Picks Up** → Money remains in escrow (protected)
3. **Carrier Delivers** → Shipper generates a 6-digit delivery code
4. **Code Entered** → Carrier enters code to confirm handoff
5. **Payment Released** → Platform fee deducted, carrier receives payout
6. **Payout** → Funds transfer to carrier's bank (2-3 business days via Stripe)

### Fee Breakdown Example (Dual-Fee Model)

| Party | Calculation | Example (base $100) |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Shipper pays** | Base + 10% service fee | $110.00 |
| **Carrier receives** | Base − 5% platform fee | $95.00 |
| **Platform total** | 10% + 5% of base = 15% | $15.00 |
| **Optional tip** | 100% to carrier | +tip amount |

### Escrow Protection
- **For Shippers**: Money isn't released until YOU generate the delivery code and carrier enters it
- **For Carriers**: Payment is guaranteed once delivery is confirmed
- **Delivery code**: 6 digits, expires after 30 minutes, regenerate if needed
- **Failed delivery**: Shipper can request refund if package not delivered

### Carrier Payout Requirements
- Must complete **Stripe Connect onboarding** (one-time setup)
- Provide bank account details to Stripe
- Payouts are automatic after each completed delivery
- View earnings anytime in "My Earnings"

### Refunds & Disputes
- **Before pickup**: Full refund available if match is cancelled
- **After pickup**: Contact support for dispute resolution
- **Damaged items**: Report immediately with photos through the app

## Cancellation Policy

### For Shippers (Cancelling a Package Request)

| When You Cancel | What Happens | Fee |
|-----------------|--------------|-----|
| Before any carrier accepts | Full refund, no penalty | Free |
| After carrier accepts, before confirmation | Full refund | Free |
| After confirmation, before pickup | Refund minus small admin fee | ~5% |
| After pickup (package in transit) | Contact support - case by case | Varies |

### For Carriers (Cancelling a Delivery)

| When You Cancel | What Happens | Impact |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| Before accepting | No impact | None |
| After accepting, before confirmation | Shipper notified, no penalty | Minor |
| After confirmation, before pickup | Shipper refunded, warning issued | Moderate |
| After pickup (you have the package) | MUST return package or deliver | Severe - account review |

### No-Show Policy
- **Carriers**: Missing 2+ pickups without notice → temporary suspension
- **Shippers**: Not available for 2+ scheduled pickups → warning, then restrictions
- Always communicate through in-app chat if plans change!

### How to Cancel
1. Go to **My Deliveries** → Select the match
2. Tap **"Cancel Delivery"**
3. Select a reason (helps us improve)
4. Confirm cancellation
5. Refund processed within 3-5 business days

## Pricing Tips

### For Carriers: Setting Competitive Rates

#### Factors to Consider
1. **Distance**: Longer routes = higher base price
2. **Fuel costs**: Factor in current gas prices
3. **Time investment**: Pickup/delivery adds time to your trip
4. **Package type**: Fragile or special handling = premium
5. **Competition**: Check what others charge for similar routes

#### Pricing Strategies
| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Per kg rate** | Standard packages | $5-15/kg depending on route |
| **Flat rate** | Small, light items | $20-50 for documents |
| **Premium rate** | Fragile, urgent, or valuable | +25-50% above standard |

#### Tips for More Deliveries
- 📈 Start slightly below market rate to build ratings
- ⭐ Maintain 4.5+ stars for visibility boost
- 📅 Post trips 1-2 weeks in advance
- 🗺️ Popular routes: Toronto↔Montreal, Vancouver↔Calgary, GTA suburbs
- 💬 Respond to requests quickly (within hours, not days)
- 📸 Add a friendly profile photo

### For Shippers: Budgeting Your Delivery

#### Typical Price Ranges (Canada, 2024)
| Route Type | Price Range | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Same city | $15-40 | Toronto to Mississauga |
| Regional (2-4 hrs) | $30-80 | Toronto to Ottawa |
| Long distance (4+ hrs) | $50-150 | Toronto to Montreal |
| Cross-country | $100-300+ | Toronto to Vancouver |

*Prices vary by package weight, urgency, and carrier availability*

#### Money-Saving Tips
- 💰 Be flexible on pickup/delivery dates
- 📦 Combine multiple small items into one package
- 🕐 Book 1-2 weeks ahead (last-minute = premium)
- ⭐ Consider newer carriers (lower rates, building reputation)
- 🤝 Build relationships with favorite carriers for repeat discounts

#### When to Pay More
- 🎁 Valuable items (peace of mind with experienced carrier)
- ⏰ Urgent deliveries (same-day or next-day)
- 🥚 Fragile items (experienced handlers)
- 📅 Holiday seasons (high demand)

### Understanding the Final Cost (Dual-Fee Model)

\`\`\`
Agreed Delivery Price (Base): $100
├── Service Fee (10%):        +$10.00 (you pay)
├── Total You Pay:            $110.00
│
├── Carrier Receives:         $95.00 (base − 5%)
├── Platform Fee Total:       $15.00 (10% + 5%)
└── Optional Tip:             You decide (100% to carrier)
\`\`\`

**Transparent pricing**: You pay the agreed price + 10% service fee. Carriers receive the agreed price minus 5%.

| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4) | Good - Minor issues |
| ⭐⭐⭐ (3) | Okay - Room for improvement |

## Troubleshooting & Support Escalation

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**"I can't create a trip/package"**
→ You need to be **Verified**. Go to Profile → Get Verified → Verify phone number.

**"I can't see carrier location"**
→ Location is only shared when status is **"Picked Up"** or **"In Transit"**. The carrier must have location permissions enabled.

**"Payment failed"**
→ Check your payment method in Profile → Payment Methods. Try a different card or contact your bank.

**"Carrier/shipper isn't responding"**
→ Wait 24 hours, then you can cancel without penalty. Report unresponsive users through their profile.

**"Delivery code isn't working"**
→ Codes expire after 30 minutes. Generate a new code in the app.

**"I was charged but delivery was cancelled"**
→ Refunds are automatic and take 3-5 business days to appear.

const BUSINESS_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW = `
## Pasabayan Business System Overview

### System Purpose

Pasabayan is a peer-to-peer delivery platform that connects people who need packages delivered (Shippers) with people who have available space in their vehicles (Carriers). Think of it as "Uber for packages" where everyday people can earn money by carrying packages during their regular trips.

### User Roles

**Carriers:**
- People with vehicles who want to earn extra money
- Create trips, accept package requests, deliver packages
- Get paid for successful deliveries
- Requirements: Vehicle, valid driver's license

**Shippers:**
- People who need packages delivered
- Create package requests, book trips, track deliveries
- Pay carriers for delivery services
- Requirements: Valid account, payment method

### Core System Components

#### 1. Package Requests
A request created by a shipper who needs something delivered.

**Key Properties:**
- Package details (title, description, size, weight, fragile status)
- Location information (pickup address, delivery address, distance)
- Timing (preferred pickup/delivery date, urgency level)
- Service type (regular delivery or shopping service)
- Pricing (maximum price, negotiation allowed)

**Package Status States:**
| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Open | Available for carriers to see and request |
| Pending | Waiting for carrier response |
| Pending Request | Shipper has requested a specific trip |
| Matched | Carrier has offered to carry the package |
| Booked | Shipper has accepted a carrier's offer |
| In Transit | Package is being delivered |
| Delivered | Successfully delivered to destination |
| Cancelled | Request cancelled by shipper or carrier |

#### 2. Trips
A planned journey created by a carrier showing their available capacity.

**Key Properties:**
- Route information (start/end locations, distance, travel time)
- Timing (departure/arrival date and time)
- Capacity (available weight, volume, max dimensions)
- Pricing (price per kilometer, min/max charge)
- Vehicle type and special services

**Trip Status States:**
| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scheduled | Trip is planned and available |
| Active | Trip is in progress |
| Completed | Trip finished successfully |
| Cancelled | Trip cancelled by carrier |

#### 3. Matches
The connection between a package request and a trip when they're compatible.

**How Matches Happen:**
- **Carrier Request:** Carrier sees a package and offers to carry it
- **Shipper Request:** Shipper finds a trip and requests to book it
- **Smart Matching:** System automatically suggests compatible options

**Match Status States:**
| Status | Description | Next Possible States |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Pending | Waiting for acceptance | Confirmed, Declined, Cancelled |
| Carrier Requested | Carrier offered to carry | Shipper Accepted, Shipper Declined |
| Shipper Requested | Shipper requested trip | Carrier Accepted, Carrier Declined |
| Carrier Accepted | Carrier accepted request | Confirmed |
| Shipper Accepted | Shipper accepted offer | Confirmed |
| Confirmed | Both parties agreed | Picked Up, Cancelled |
| Picked Up | Package collected | In Transit, Cancelled |
| In Transit | Package being delivered | Delivered |
| Delivered | Delivery completed | Final state |
| Cancelled | Match cancelled | Final state |
| Shipper Declined | Shipper declined offer | Final state (or Counter-Offer) |
| Carrier Declined | Carrier declined request | Final state (or Counter-Offer) |

#### 4. Counter-Offer System

When a request is declined, either party can make a counter-offer:

| Scenario | Who Declines | Counter-Offer Option |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Shipper requests trip | Carrier declines | Carrier can propose a different price |
| Carrier offers to carry | Shipper declines | Shipper can propose a different price |

**Counter-Offer Flow:**
1. User declines a request/offer
2. System prompts: "Would you like to make a counter-offer?"
3. User enters new price and optional message
4. Other party receives notification with new price
5. Other party can: Accept, Decline, or Counter-Offer back

**Example Negotiation:**
- Round 1: Shipper offers $50
- Round 2: Carrier counters with $70
- Round 3: Shipper counters with $60
- Round 4: Carrier accepts $60 → Booking proceeds

#### 5. Ratings & Reviews
Feedback system where users rate each other after completed deliveries.

**Rating Components:**
- Star Rating: 1-5 stars (1 = poor, 5 = excellent)
- Written Review: Optional text feedback
- Quick Tags: Punctual, Professional, Careful handling, Good communication, Would recommend

**Rating Categories:**
- Overall Experience
- Carrier Performance / Package Accuracy
- Communication
- Timeliness

#### 6. Chat System
Real-time messaging between shippers and carriers.

**Features:**
- Text messages and photo sharing
- Status updates (automatic notifications)
- File sharing (documents, receipts)
- Real-time delivery with read receipts
- Complete message history

**Triggers:**
- Automatically created when a match is confirmed
- Used for coordination and updates
- Continues until delivery is complete

#### 7. Payment System

**Payment Flow:**
1. Agreed Price: Set when match is confirmed
2. Auto-Charge: Payment is automatically charged when shipper confirms booking
3. Carrier Payout: Carrier receives payment after successful delivery (via Stripe Connect)

| Refunded | Payment returned to shipper |
| Disputed | Payment under review |
| Cancelled | Payment cancelled before completion |

**Verification Levels:**
| Level | Description | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Incomplete | Profile setup not finished | Basic info required |
| Basic | Basic profile provided | Email verification |
| Verified | Identity and phone verified | Phone + basic ID |
| Premium | Enhanced verification | Full ID + background check |

## iOS Data Flow Architecture

**A Comprehensive Guide to MVVM + Functional Programming Data Flow**

### Architecture Overview

The Pasabayan iOS app follows a **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture enhanced with **Functional Programming** principles, creating a unidirectional data flow with immutable state management.

#### Core Architecture Components

\`\`\`
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│    View     │◄───│  ViewModel  │◄───│   Service   │◄───│    Model    │
│  (SwiftUI)  │    │(State Mgmt) │    │(Business)   │    │(Data Types) │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
       │                   │                   │                   │
   User Input         State Updates      API Calls         Data Structure
   Interactions       Pure Functions     Network Layer     Immutable Types
\`\`\`

#### Key Principles

- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction through the architecture
- **Immutable State**: All state changes create new instances rather than mutating existing ones
- **Pure Functions**: Business logic functions have no side effects
- **Feature-based architecture**: Each feature is self-contained

        VM-->>V: @Published Error State
        V->>V: Show Error UI
    end
\`\`\`

---

### State Management

The codebase uses **two ViewModel patterns** depending on complexity needs:

#### Pattern 1: Immutable State Structure (Complex Features)

Used for features with complex state and form handling (e.g., \`AuthViewModel\`):

\`\`\`swift
@MainActor
class AuthViewModel: ObservableObject {
    struct State: Equatable {
        let isAuthenticated: Bool
        let currentUser: User?
        let isLoading: Bool
        let errorMessage: String?
        let validationErrors: [String: ValidationResult]
        let formData: FormData

        static let initial = State(
            isAuthenticated: false,
            currentUser: nil,
            isLoading: false,
            errorMessage: nil,
            validationErrors: [:],
            formData: FormData.initial
        )

        struct FormData: Equatable {
            let email: String
            let password: String
            let confirmPassword: String
            let name: String
            let phone: String

            static let initial = FormData(
                email: "", password: "", confirmPassword: "", name: "", phone: ""
            )
        }
    }

    @Published private(set) var state = State.initial

    // Pure function for state updates
    private func updateState(_ transform: (State) -> State) {
        state = transform(state)
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### Pattern 2: Simple Published Properties (Standard Features)

Used for features with simpler state (e.g., \`MatchingViewModel\`, \`ProfileViewModel\`):

\`\`\`swift
class MatchingViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var matches: [DeliveryMatch] = []
    @Published var isLoading: Bool = false
    @Published var errorMessage: String?
    @Published var matchAccepted: Bool = false

    private let apiService: BookingsAPIServicing
    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    init(apiService: BookingsAPIServicing = BookingsAPIService.shared) {
        self.apiService = apiService
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### When to Use Each Pattern

| Pattern | Use When | Examples |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Immutable State | Complex forms, validation, nested state | \`AuthViewModel\` |
| Simple Published | List data, simple loading states | \`MatchingViewModel\`, \`ProfileViewModel\`, \`FavoritesViewModel\` |

---

### Feature-Specific Flows

#### Booking/Matching Flow

\`\`\`mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending: Match Created
    pending --> carrier_requested: Carrier Offers
    pending --> shipper_requested: Shipper Requests

    carrier_requested --> shipper_accepted: Shipper Accepts
    carrier_requested --> shipper_declined: Shipper Declines

    shipper_requested --> carrier_accepted: Carrier Accepts
    shipper_requested --> carrier_declined: Carrier Declines

    shipper_accepted --> confirmed: Both Agree + Payment
    carrier_accepted --> confirmed: Both Agree + Payment

    confirmed --> picked_up: Pickup Code Verified
    picked_up --> in_transit: Carrier Starts Transit
    in_transit --> delivered: Delivery Code Verified

    delivered --> [*]: Complete
    shipper_declined --> [*]: Declined
    carrier_declined --> [*]: Declined
\`\`\`

**Key Components:**
- \`MatchingViewModel\` - Manages match state and API calls
- \`BookingsAPIService\` - API methods for match operations
- \`DeliveryMatch\` - Model with computed properties for status logic

#### Payment Flow (Auto-Charge)

\`\`\`mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Shipper
    participant VM as PaymentViewModel
    participant PS as PaymentService
    participant Stripe as Stripe API
    participant API as Backend API

    S->>VM: Confirm booking
    VM->>PS: processAutoCharge(matchId, amount)
    PS->>API: POST /api/payments/create-intent
    API-->>PS: PaymentIntent (client_secret)
    PS->>Stripe: Confirm PaymentIntent
    Stripe-->>PS: Payment succeeded
    PS->>API: POST /api/payments/confirm
    API-->>PS: Transaction record
    PS-->>VM: Payment complete
    VM-->>S: Show success, booking confirmed
\`\`\`

**Key Components:**
- \`PaymentViewModel\` - Orchestrates payment flow
- \`PaymentService\` - Stripe SDK integration
- \`StripeConfigService\` - Publishable key management

---

### API Service Layer Pattern

All feature services extend \`BaseFeatureAPIService\`:

\`\`\`swift
// Base class provides common functionality
class BaseFeatureAPIService {
    let apiService: APIService

    init(apiService: APIService = APIService.shared) {
        self.apiService = apiService
    }

    func makeRequest<T: Decodable>(
        endpoint: String,
        method: HTTPMethod,
        body: Encodable? = nil,
        responseType: T.Type
    ) -> AnyPublisher<T, APIError>
}

// Feature service extends base
class BookingsAPIService: BaseFeatureAPIService {
    static let shared = BookingsAPIService()

    func getCarrierMatches() -> AnyPublisher<PaginatedResponse<DeliveryMatch>, APIError> {
        makeRequest(
            endpoint: "/matches/carrier",
            method: .GET,
            responseType: PaginatedResponse<DeliveryMatch>.self
        )
    }

    func acceptMatch(id: Int) -> AnyPublisher<DeliveryMatch, APIError> {
        makeRequest(
            endpoint: "/matches/\\(id)/accept",
            method: .PUT,
            responseType: MatchResponse.self
        )
        .map(\\.data)
        .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

### Best Practices

#### State Management
\`\`\`swift
// ✅ DO: Use immutable state with functional updates
private func updateState(_ transform: (State) -> State) {
    state = transform(state)
}

// ❌ DON'T: Mutate state directly
state.isLoading = true  // Avoid this

// ✅ DO: Compose validation functions
let result = emailValidation.combine(with: passwordValidation)
\`\`\`

#### Component Communication
\`\`\`swift
// ✅ DO: Use callbacks for child-to-parent communication
struct EmailField: View {
    let value: String
    let validationResult: ValidationResult?
    let onChange: (String) -> Void  // Callback

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Email", text: .constant(value))
            .onChange(of: value) { newValue in
                onChange(newValue)  // Pure callback
            }
    }
}

// ✅ DO: Use @StateObject for view model ownership
struct AuthView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = AuthViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        EmailField(
            value: viewModel.state.formData.email,
            validationResult: viewModel.state.validationErrors["email"],
            onChange: viewModel.updateEmail
        )
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Key Files by Feature

| Feature | ViewModel | Service | Key Model |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Auth | \`AuthViewModel.swift\` | \`AuthService.swift\` | \`User.swift\` |
| Bookings | \`MatchingViewModel.swift\` | \`BookingsAPIService.swift\` | \`Booking.swift\`, \`DeliveryMatch\` |
| Packages | \`PackageViewModel.swift\` | \`PackagesAPIService.swift\` | \`PackageRequest.swift\` |
| Trips | \`BrowseTripsViewModel.swift\` | \`TripsAPIService.swift\` | \`Trip.swift\` |
| Payments | \`PaymentViewModel.swift\` | \`PaymentService.swift\` | \`PaymentModels.swift\` |
| Profile | \`ProfileViewModel.swift\` | \`ProfileAPIService.swift\` | \`UserProfile\` |
| Chat | \`ChatViewModel.swift\` | \`ChatAPIService.swift\` | \`ChatModels.swift\` |
| Favorites | \`FavoritesViewModel.swift\` | \`FavoritesAPIService.swift\` | \`FavoriteCarrier.swift\` |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Data flows unidirectionally** from Models → Services → ViewModels → Views
2. **State is always immutable** and updated through pure functions
3. **Side effects are isolated** to service layers and async functions
4. **Components communicate** through props down, callbacks up pattern
5. **Validation is pure** and composable across the application
6. **Error handling is comprehensive** with user-friendly messages and recovery options

## Auto-Charge Payment Flow

### What is Auto-Charge?

When a **Shipper** confirms a match with a carrier, the system automatically charges their default payment method. This eliminates the need for a separate payment step after matching.

### Auto-Charge UI Flow

\`\`\`
Profile Tab → Payment Methods → Add Card
    └── Stripe Payment Sheet appears
        └── Enter card details (4242 4242 4242 4242)
            └── Card saved as default

Matches Tab → Pending Confirmation booking → Tap "Confirm Booking"
    │
    ├── IF has saved card:
    │   └── Dialog shows: "Card ****1234 will be charged $XX"
    │       └── Tap "Confirm & Pay" → Card auto-charged
    │
    └── IF no saved card:
        └── Prompt: "Add payment method" → Add card first
\`\`\`

### Auto-Charge Test Scenarios

| Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| Happy Path | Has card → Confirm booking | Auto-charged, status "Confirmed & Paid" |
| No Card | No saved card → Confirm | Prompted to add card first |
| Declined Card | Use 4000000000000002 → Confirm | "Payment Failed" error, can retry |
| Different Card | Ready to confirm → "Use different card" | Can select/add another card |

### Auto-Charge Confirmation Sheet States

| State | Icon | What's Shown |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Loading | Spinner | "Checking payment method..." |
| No Card | Orange card (60pt) | "Payment Method Required" + Add button |
| Ready | Green shield (60pt) | Price + Card info + "Confirm & Pay" |
| Processing | Spinner | "Confirming match..." |
| Success | Green check (80pt) | "Match Confirmed!" auto-dismisses |
| Error | Red triangle (60pt) | Error message + "Try Again" |

### Payment Flow (Shipper)

**Add Card Flow:**
\`\`\`
Profile → Payment Methods → Add Card → Stripe Sheet (card saved)
\`\`\`

**Confirm Match Flow:**
\`\`\`
Matches → open Match → Match Details
    └── If status = pending:
        └── Tap "Confirm Match"
             ├── If card exists → shows "Confirm & Pay"
             └── If no card → "Add Payment Method"
\`\`\`

**Auto‑charge Failure Flow:**
\`\`\`
Match Details → Auto‑Charge Failure Banner
    ├── Try Again (retry charge)
    └── Update Card → Payment Methods
\`\`\`

### Manual Payment Flow (Shipper)

**Trigger:** \`shouldShowPaymentButton\` = true when:
- match.status = \`confirmed\` AND
- (auto-charge failed OR no default card)

\`\`\`
Shipper → Matches tab
    └── Open match → ShipperMatchDetailsView
        └── If match.status = confirmed AND (auto-charge failed OR no default card)
            └── "Pay CAD $XX" button appears
                └── Tap Pay
                    └── Stripe PaymentSheet opens
                        └── Enter / choose card
                            └── Tap "Pay $XX" → Success
\`\`\`

### Manual Payment Test

| Step | Screen | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Matches Tab | Find booking with payment issue | Card shows payment banner |
| 2 | Match Details | Verify failure banner | "Payment failed" banner visible |
| 3 | Match Details | Verify "Pay" button | Button is visible and enabled |
| 4 | Match Details | Tap "Pay" | Stripe PaymentSheet opens |
| 5 | PaymentSheet | Enter card OR select saved | Card info entered/selected |
| 6 | PaymentSheet | Tap "Pay $XX" | Processing indicator |
| 7 | PaymentSheet | Wait | Success confirmation |
| 8 | Match Details | Check status | Status updates, banner removed |

### Auto-Charge Failure Banner

**Component:** AutoChargeFailureBanner
**Trigger:** \`transactionStatus == "failed"\`
**Appears on:** MatchDetailsView, ShipperMatchDetailsView

| Scenario | Banner Message | Action |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Card declined | "Payment failed - card declined" | "Pay" button |
| Insufficient funds | "Payment failed - insufficient funds" | "Pay" button |
| Card expired | "Payment failed - card expired" | "Pay" button |
| No payment method | "No payment method on file" | "Add Card" / "Pay" |

### Failure Banner Test Cards

| Test | Card Number | Expected Banner |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Declined | 4000000000000002 | "declined" message |
| Insufficient funds | 4000000000009995 | "insufficient funds" |
| Expired | 4000000000000069 | "expired" message |
| No card | (remove all cards) | "no payment method" |

### Carrier Payout UI Flow

\`\`\`
Carrier → Profile Tab → Payments → Transaction History
    └── Transaction list
        └── Tap a transaction
            └── TransactionDetailView
                ├── Amount breakdown (total, platform fee, carrier receives)
                ├── Participants
                ├── Payout Status Card (if completed / payout available)
                ├── Payout date (if paid)
                ├── Refund / tip info if present
                └── Timeline
\`\`\`

**Where Receipts Live:**
\`\`\`
Profile → Payments → Receipts → ReceiptListView
\`\`\`
- Receipts are PDF-style payment receipts, not a payout list.

**Key distinction:**
- **Payout status** = TransactionDetailView (via Transaction History)
- **Receipts** = ReceiptListView (PDF receipts)

### Carrier Payout Test

| Step | Screen | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Carrier | Complete delivery flow | Status: "Delivered" |
| 2 | Profile | Go to Payments → Transaction History | Transaction list opens |
| 3 | Transaction list | Find recent delivery | Transaction row visible |
| 4 | Transaction row | Tap to open | TransactionDetailView opens |
| 5 | TransactionDetailView | Check amount breakdown | Platform fee + carrier receives shown |
| 6 | TransactionDetailView | Check payout status | "Pending" initially, then "Paid" |

### Payment Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Delivery completes → **Shipper** transaction appears in Profile → Payments → Transaction History
- [ ] Delivery completes → **Carrier** transaction appears in Profile → Payments → Transaction History
- [ ] Payout setup accessible for carriers (Profile → Payments → Payout Setup)
- [ ] Auto‑charge failure routes to Payment Methods (via bell notification)
- [ ] Auto‑charge failure banner shows **Try Again** and **Update Card** in Match Details
- [ ] Notifications route correctly (bell → tap → correct destination)

## Minimum Delivery Price

### Overview

Minimum delivery price: **$5.00 CAD** (configurable via API)

- **Client-side**: Immediate validation in UI
- **Server-side**: API returns 422 if price below minimum

### Where Minimum Applies

| Screen | Minimum Applies? | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Shipper booking trip (MatchCreationView) | YES | Must be ≥ $5.00 |
| Carrier proposing price (RequestToCarrySheet) | NO | Can propose $0 for negotiation |
| Trip creation (price per kg) | NO | Rate not total price |

### Test Cases

| Input | Expected |
|-------|----------|
| Empty | Error: "Price must be at least CA$5.00" |
| $0 | Error |
| $4.99 | Error |
| $5.00 | Valid ✓ |
| $15.00 | Valid ✓ |

### API Error Response (if bypassed)

\`\`\`json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "PRICE_BELOW_MINIMUM",
    "message": "Price must be at least $5.00",
    "details": { "min_price": 5.00, "provided_price": 2.00 }
  }
}
\`\`\`
Status: 422

## Counter-Offer Flow

### How Counter-Offers Work

\`\`\`
Shipper requests booking at $50
    │
    ▼
Carrier receives request → Taps "Decline"
    │
    ▼
Counter-Offer Prompt appears:
    ├── Shows declined price (crossed out)
    ├── Shows carrier's rate reference
    ├── Enter counter amount (e.g., $70)
    └── Tap "Send Offer"
        │
        ▼
Shipper receives notification → Can:
    ├── Accept $70 → Proceeds to Confirm & Pay
    ├── Decline → Booking cancelled
    └── Counter back (e.g., $60) → Back to carrier
\`\`\`

### Counter-Offer Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| Carrier counters $70 | Shipper sees banner, can accept/decline/counter |
| Shipper accepts | Price updated to $70, auto-charge on confirm |
| Shipper counters $60 | Carrier notified, status "Awaiting Response" |
| Final acceptance | Agreed price used for auto-charge |

## Matches vs Packages (Visual Guide)

This is a quick visual guide that shows how **Packages** and **Matches** differ, and how a **Match connects a Package + Trip**.

### The Big Picture

\`\`\`
Package (what shipper creates)
    │
    │  carrier offers / shipper requests
    ▼
Match (the negotiation + delivery)
    ▲
    │  carrier trip chosen
    │
Trip (what carrier creates)
\`\`\`

**Think of it this way:**
- **Package** = the item + request details (created by the shipper)
- **Trip** = the carrier's travel plan (created by the carrier)
- **Match** = the agreement that links a specific Package to a specific Trip

### Side‑by‑Side Snapshot (Key Fields)

| Concept | What it represents | Key fields |
|---------|--------------------|------------|
| **Package** | The shipment request | \`package_id\`, \`pickup_city\`, \`delivery_city\`, \`weight_kg\`, \`max_price_budget\`, \`status\` |
| **Trip** | The carrier's trip route | \`trip_id\`, \`origin_city\`, \`destination_city\`, \`price_per_kg\`, \`status\` |
| **Match** | The negotiation + delivery | \`match_id\`, \`package_request_id\`, \`carrier_trip_id\`, \`agreed_price\`, \`match_status\`, \`is_counter_offer\` |

### Quick Diagram: What's on Package vs Match

\`\`\`
PACKAGE (shipper creates)          MATCH (negotiation + delivery)
┌────────────────────────┐         ┌────────────────────────┐
│ package_id             │         │ match_id               │
│ pickup_city            │         │ agreed_price           │
│ delivery_city          │         │ match_status           │
│ weight_kg              │         │ is_counter_offer       │
│ max_price_budget       │         │                        │
│ status                 │         │ package_request_id ────┼──→ links to Package
└────────────────────────┘         │ carrier_trip_id ───────┼──→ links to Trip
                                   └────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

### Package Lifecycle (Shipper‑side)

\`\`\`
Drafted → Open (waiting for carrier) → Matched → In Transit → Delivered
                         │                │           │
                         └────────────→ Cancelled ←───┘
\`\`\`

**Plain English:** You create a package, wait for carrier interest, pick a carrier, then track delivery.

### Match Lifecycle (Negotiation + Delivery)

\`\`\`
Offer/Request → Counter‑Offer (optional) → Confirmed → Picked Up → In Transit → Delivered
       │                 │                  │            │            │
       └────────────→ Declined/Cancelled ←──┴────────────┴────────────┘
\`\`\`

**Plain English:** A match starts when someone makes an offer, may go through counter‑offers, then becomes a delivery once confirmed.

**Chat connection:** Once a match exists, a chat thread can appear in **Messages** tab for communication between shipper and carrier.

### Example Data

**Package #179**
\`\`\`
Pickup: Toronto, CA
Delivery: Montreal, CA
Weight: 2.5 kg
Max Budget: CAD 80.00
Status: open
\`\`\`

**Trip #254**
\`\`\`
From: Toronto, CA
To: Montreal, CA
Rate: CAD 12.00 / kg
Status: active
\`\`\`

**Match #456** (this is the link)
\`\`\`
package_request_id: 179
carrier_trip_id: 254
agreed_price: CAD 70.00
match_status: carrier_requested
is_counter_offer: true
\`\`\`

**Key idea:** The **Match** links **Package** and **Trip** via:
\`\`\`
package_request_id  → Package #179
carrier_trip_id     → Trip #254
\`\`\`

### Where You See Them in the App

| Tab | Shows | Contains |
|-----|-------|----------|
| **Packages tab** | Package objects | What shipper created |
| **Matches tab** | Match objects | The negotiation + delivery |

A **Match** always points back to the original **Package** and the chosen **Trip**.

### Quick Mental Model

\`\`\`
Package = "What I want shipped"
Trip    = "Where I'm traveling"
Match   = "We agreed to ship it on that trip"
\`\`\`

## Matching Testing Guide - UI Flow

### Overview

This guide covers the complete booking/matching flow between Shippers and Carriers. Follow the screen paths and verify expected results at each step.

**Two-Way Matching System:**
- **Shipper-Initiated**: Shipper finds a carrier's trip and requests to book space
- **Carrier-Initiated**: Carrier finds a shipper's package and offers to carry it

Both flows require acceptance from the other party before the booking is confirmed.

### C. DETAIL SCREENS (Both Roles)

#### C1. Counter-Offer banner appears in details
**Where:** View Details

**Steps**
1. Open a counter-offer match.
2. Tap **View Details**.

**Expected result**
- **Counter-Offer banner** shows original price vs new price.
- Banner displays remaining offers if available.

#### C2. Remaining counter-offers in status banner
**Where:** CounterOfferStatusBanner (details)

**Steps**
1. Perform a counter-offer (or open a match with warnings/negotiation).
2. Observe the **CounterOfferStatusBanner**.

**Expected result**
- If remaining > 0 → "X counter-offer(s) remaining"
- If remaining = 0 → "Counter-offer limit reached"

---

### D. NOTIFICATION FLOW

#### D1. Open counter-offer from notification
**Steps**
1. Tap the **Counter-Offer** push notification.

**Expected result**
- App opens match details.
- Counter-Offer banner is visible immediately.

---

### E. LEGACY DATA (Backward Compatibility)

#### E1. Old matches without metadata
**Steps**
1. Open a match created before backend updates.

**Expected result**
- Counter-offer banner may still show if message parsing works.
- Remaining counter-offer count is not shown (data missing).

---

### Test Data Suggestions
Use Admin Panel **Counter-Offer Test** to create:
- Round 1 → remaining = 1 (Counter Offer visible)
- Round 2 → remaining = 0 (Counter Offer hidden, limit reached)

---

### Pass/Fail Criteria
**Pass** if:
- Counter Offer is visible only when \`can_counter_offer = true\`.
- Remaining count displays when provided.
- Limit reached hides counter-offer and shows the limit message.
- Decline does **not** auto-open counter-offer prompt.
